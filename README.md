# Jewellery_AI

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Image Data: Retrieve images from cloud object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
Textual Data: Extract descriptions and labels from the relational database.
    
2. Model Development:
Image Processing Model: Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image analysis. Use a pre-trained model like ResNet or EfficientNet, fine-tuned on the jewellery images dataset.
Text Generation Model: Train a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model for generating product descriptions. You can use models like GPT-3, GPT-2, or a custom-trained LSTM model.

3. Integration and Deployment:
Integration with Cloud Services:
Use boto3 (for AWS) or equivalent libraries to interact with cloud object storage.
Ensure secure access to cloud storage with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Integration with Relational Database:
Use mysql-connector-python or equivalent libraries to connect to the relational database.
Retrieve product descriptions and labels from the database.

API Development:
Develop an API using Flask or FastAPI to handle incoming requests.
Implement endpoints for uploading images and receiving generated product information.

Frontend Development:
Create a user interface for artisans to interact with the platform, allowing them to upload images and view generated product information.
Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js for frontend development.

Deployment:
Deploy the API and frontend to a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Heroku.
Ensure scalability, availability, and security of the deployed system.

4. Testing and Evaluation:
Unit Testing: Test individual components of the system (e.g., image processing, text generation) to ensure they function as expected.

Integration Testing: Test the interaction between different components to verify the system's overall functionality.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Allow artisans to use the platform and provide feedback on the generated product information.

Performance Evaluation: Measure the system's performance metrics such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization under varying loads.

5. Monitoring and Maintenance:
Monitoring: Set up monitoring tools to track system performance, detect errors, and monitor resource usage.

Maintenance: Regularly update models and system components to incorporate improvements and address issues.

Feedback Loop: Gather feedback from artisans and customers to continuously improve the quality of generated product information.

By following this plan, the jewellery marketplace can enhance its platform with AI technology, streamline the listing process for artisans, improve product information consistency, and enhance the shopping experience for customers.


Database credentials and AWS keys are fetched from environment variables for security purposes.
Database connection now uses dictionary cursor (cursor = conn.cursor(dictionary=True)) for easier data manipulation.
Environment variables are used to specify the bucket name and prefix for S3 image retrieval.
The suggested changes regarding error handling, data validation, model fine-tuning, optimization, documentation, and testing are not implemented here but are important considerations for further development.

replace the DB details

 "DB_HOST", "DB_USER", "DB_PASSWORD", "DB_NAME", "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "S3_BUCKET_NAME", and "S3_PREFIX" with your actual values or set them as environment variables.
